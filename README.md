# Jewel Architecture
Jewel Architecture is a fusion of DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture‚Äîa pattern that leverages their individual strengths to **create scalable, maintainable, and valuable systems.**
I call it Jewel Architecture because it organizes your system into multifaceted, interchangeable components, creating a highly valuable and mantainable structure‚Äîlike a finely cut gem.
Furthermore, Jewel Architecture leverages the usage of the Unit Of Work (UOW) pattern: this implementation includes buffering and dispatching of aggregate events to **preserve the domain logic's purity** while ensuring consistency in persistence and event publishing.

## Foundation Principles
**0. Grounded in SOLID principles:** Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

**1. The Domain is Central:** It is self-contained and free from dependencies.

**2. The Application Layer Supports the Domain:** Its role is to provide the domain with the necessary context and data for business decisions.

**3. Commands Drive Change:** Any action that modifies the system's state is encapsulated in a Command.

**4. Queries Provide Insight:** Reading and retrieving data from the system is handled through Queries.

**5. Cross-Cutting Concerns are Extensible:** Decorators are a clean and flexible way to manage these concerns.

**6. Focused Interaction:** The application layer exposes Use Cases or Services, offering clear entry points for the interface layer.
  
## Examples
This repository contains solutions structured using the Jewel Architecture, like for example a simplified **Smart Charging** domain.
Or even a fun version of the **Pok√©dex**, where under certain conditions, the description of a Pok√©mon is translated into Yoda's or Shakespeare's language.
The examples use the solution **JewelArchitecture.Core as a base** to implement the specific domain logic. The example projects mirror the structure of the core with the 4 layers: Application, Domain, Interface and an optional Infrastructure level.

## Solution Structure
The solutions use an aggregate-based folder structure and follows a clean architecture, with the following key layers:

**- Application Layer:** Contains use cases, services and business logic.

**- Domain Layer:** Defines entities, aggregates, value objects, invariants and domain logic.

**- Infrastructure Layer:** Optional infrastructure components (in-memory database used here).

**- Interface Layer:** ASP.NET Core Web API exposing application endpoints.

## Customization
- If you need to implement **cross-cutting concerns** like logging, auditing, exceptions handling: Decorators for Commands, Queries or Use Cases are a clean and flexible way to manage these concerns.

- If you need to go **full async with CQRS**: It is enough to write Commands in a queue and then move the handlers in a separate background process or dedicated worker that processes them asynchronously. Also, queries can go full async as well, if you expect long time processing. That would require a response location, like an endpoind dedicated for polling the result or a push notification mechanism.

- If you need to manage **domain events** in a **loosely coupled** and persistent way: You can publish them in a message bus and let the subscribers handle them. Therefore, in that case consider replacing the in-memory event dispatcher with a Pub/Sub external dependency and move the domain event handlers to specific subscriber components. 

- If you need to add persistent storage, transactional support or external dependencies in the future, consider replacing the in-memory repository with another database implementation, adding external services, or configuring additional infrastructure components.

## Smart Charging Prerequisites
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed on your machine
  
It is an ASP.NET Core Web API project built with .NET 8. The API is configured with Swagger for API documentation and uses an in-memory database, so no external dependencies are required.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

cd Examples
cd SmartCharging
```
### 2. Build the Solution
Use the .NET CLI to restore and build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```
### 3. Run the Application
Run the application using the .NET CLI.
