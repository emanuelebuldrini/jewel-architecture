# Jewel Architecture
Jewel Architecture is a fusion of DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architectureâ€”a pattern that leverages their individual strengths to create scalable, maintainable, and valuable systems.
This repository contains examples structured using the Jewel Architecture. It contains an example of a simplified Smart Charging solution. It is an ASP.NET Core Web API project built with .NET 8. The API is configured with Swagger for API documentation and uses an in-memory database, so no external dependencies are required.

## Smart Charging Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed on your machine

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emanuelebuldrini/jewel-architecture.git
cd Examples
cd SmartCharging
```
### 2. Build the Solution
Use the .NET CLI to restore and build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```
### 3. Run the Application
Run the application using the .NET CLI.
```bash
dotnet run --project ".\JewelArchitecture.Examples.SmartCharging.WebApi\JewelArchitecture.Examples.SmartCharging.WebApi.csproj"
```
### 4. Access the Application
Once running, you can access the Swagger API documentation at:

HTTP: http://localhost:5253/swagger

### 5. Test the Application
To run tests for the application, use:
```bash
dotnet test
```
### 6. Project Structure
This project follows a clean architecture, with the following key layers:

- Application Layer: Contains use cases and business logic.
- Domain Layer (Core): Defines entities and aggregates, using an in-memory repository implementation for simplicity.
- Infrastructure Layer: Optional infrastructure components (in-memory database used here).
- Presentation Layer: ASP.NET Core Web API exposing application endpoints.
### 7. Customization
If you need to add persistent storage or external dependencies in the future, consider replacing the in-memory repository with a real database implementation, adding external services, or configuring additional infrastructure components.
